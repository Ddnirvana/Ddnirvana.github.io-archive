# About ME
My name is Dong Du, a researcher at the Institute of parallel and distributed systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
My research interests include operating systems, system security (TEE), serverless computing and HW/SW co-design. 
I have built several systems including Penglai TEE (state-of-the-art RISC-V TEE),
serverless systems (Catalyzer, ServerlessBench, and Molecule),
and RISC-V IPC extension (XPC).
