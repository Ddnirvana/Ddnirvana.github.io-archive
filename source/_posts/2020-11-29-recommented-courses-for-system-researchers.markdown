Here is a list of (my personally) recommented courses for system researchers, and the reasons.

- [MIT 6.004: Computation Structure](https://6004.mit.edu/web/fall20/resources/sp20): This course will introduce basic knowledge about modern Processors, and take RISC-V as an example for Labs/Demos. [Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c23MThWhXMw) and [Slides](https://6004.mit.edu/web/_static/silvina-test/resources/fa19/L14.pdf).


I will update the list when I recall or meet interesting courses.
Besides, if you have interesting courses want to share, just let me know through my email.
